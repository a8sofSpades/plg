INCIDENT REPORT: HAZMAT RELEASE - LEE HIGHWAY, MANASSAS, VA
DATE: June 4, 2016
TIME: 15:00 (3:00 PM) EDT
LOCATION: Southern Railway crossing at Lee Highway (US Route 29), near Manassas, VA.
INCIDENT TYPE: Transportation accident leading to hazardous material release (chlorine gas).

INCIDENT SUMMARY
At 15:00 on June 4, 2016, a freight train collided with a stalled truck at the Lee Highway (US-29) railway crossing. The truck was carrying three 150-pound chlorine cylinders. The collision damaged all cylinders, resulting in the simultaneous release of pressurized liquid chlorine, which vaporized into a gas cloud. Two highway maintenance workers conducting pothole repairs approximately 1.8 km west of the John Marshall Highway (SR-55)/Lee Highway intersection were overcome by the gas and required hospitalization for chlorine inhalation.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
-Wind: Easterly at 6 mph (2.7 m/s), measured at 3 m height.
-Temperature: 72°F (22.2°C).
-Humidity: 80%.
-Cloud Cover: 1/3 (scattered clouds).
-Atmospheric Stability: Neutral (Pasquill Stability Class D). No low-level inversion present.
-Terrain: Flat, open land with no obstructions between the release site and the worker location.

DAMAGE & CASUALTIES
Material Damage: Train and truck severely damaged; three chlorine cylinders breached.

Injuries: Two highway maintenance workers exposed to chlorine gas at Lee Highway, ~1.8 km west of SR-55 intersection. Symptoms included respiratory distress, coughing, and mucosal irritation. Transported to local hospital for treatment.

ANALYSIS OF CHLORINE EXPOSURE
Using the Gaussian Puff Dispersion Model for a neutral atmosphere (Class D) and an instantaneous release:

Release Parameters:
Total chlorine released: 3 cylinders × 150 lbs = 450 lbs (204 kg).

Effective release height: Ground level (truck bed).


RECOMMENDATIONS
Immediate evacuation and medical intervention were critical. Secure accident site; conduct decontamination.
Implement real-time atmospheric monitoring during future hazmat responses.
